## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Bun
- Rust
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yorunoken/hanami-manga.git
   cd hanami-manga
   ```

2. Set up root:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure environment variables:

    For the backend:
        - Navigate to the `backend` folder
        - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
        - Open `.env` and fill in your Discord bot token:
        ```
        PORT=8000
        DATABASE_URL=sqlite://data.db
        ```

    For the frontend:
        - Navigate to the `frontend` folder
        - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
        - The default configuration should work, but you can modify if needed:
        ```
        BACKEND_PORT=8000
        PORT=3000
        ```
        be sure to change the port value in `frontend/src/lib/index.ts` if you end up changing the port.

4. Install the front end dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```

5. Build backend and frontend
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
